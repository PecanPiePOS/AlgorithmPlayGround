/*
 
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
 
 Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 Output: 6
 
 Input: root = []
 Output: 0
 
 Input: root = [1]
 Output: 1
